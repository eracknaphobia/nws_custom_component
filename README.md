For HA .87 and lower
```
<config directory>/custom_components/sensor/nws_alerts.py
```
For HA .88 and higher (rename nws_alerts.py to sensor.py)
```
<config directory>/custom_components/nws_alerts/sensor.py
```
For HA .92 and higher (add an empty file named __init__.py to the folder nws_alerts)
```
<config directory>/custom_components/nws_alerts/__init__.py
```

To create an sensor instance add to your sensor definitions:
```
- platform: nws_alerts
  zone_id: 'PAC049'
```
or comma separated values

```
- platform: nws_alerts
  zone_id: 'PAC049,WVC031'
